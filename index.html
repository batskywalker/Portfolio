            <p>Hi I'm Aaron. I'm currently a web designer with a passion for programming and attempting to make video games. For every project I work on in my free time, I try to learn something new. Because of that, I find myself working on many different aspects of game development. </p>

                <h1>AllSpace</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>AllSpace is a game I made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023" target="_blank">2023 lowrezjam</a>. I can't think of a genre to describe the game, but I meant it to be an eerie game about exploring a damaged spaceship. The main gameplay loop consists of moving around the ship based on a map of the ship from before it was broken. A sensor warning you when theres something in front of you will aid you in finding damage blocking you from moving through the ship. When you find this damage, you can use LISA's LiDAR technology (which is actually, in engine, a bunch of raycasts that finds the distance from the rover and displays a certain brightness for that object based on the distance) to collect evidence of damage. Then you can return to the ships airlock and see the cost of the damages you found.</p>
                    <p>This is the only game I have available to play on Itch.</p>

                <h1>Tank Tactics</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>The basic rules for this game are explained very well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOYbR-Q_4Hs&t=248s">this video</a>, which is where I got the idea from, but the general rules are: everyone starts the game with 3 action points, 3 health, and 1 range. Everyone can submit actions, like moving, shooting, giving points, or increasing shooting range. When a player submits an action, it adds it to a queue. Everyday at 12pm, everyones actions get executed in the order they were submitted, and then everyone got an action point. A player wins when they're the last player alive.</p>
                    <p>The actions were submitted using a discord bot, and the map was displayed on a website that I made that I always kept running on my computer. It allowed everyone to see whatever information they needed. I was able to get about 20 people together to play quite a few games of this over the course of a few months, and it was a lot of fun.</p>
                    <p>I ended up adding new features as time went on, although people started playing less and less, and eventually I decided to just stop running the game off my laptop and I deleted the server. So, these are the only pictures I could salvage from the game since then.</p>

                <h1>Asteroids Clone... Kinda</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>The goal of this game is the same as asteroids, survive and destroy asteroids. However, when you get hit, a random part of your ship gets damaged, which will effect how your ship works. To fix the damage, you need to enter the code that shows in the monitor on the left into the right order on the big buttons in the middle of the console. The materials were all free assets online, but everything else, including the models was made by me.</p>
                    <p>I made this for my first game design community college class. It was a class all about using Godot 2d and learning about game design. I didn't exactly stick to the 2d part.</p>
                    <p>By this time I was already used to the idea of a game engine, having been learning unity up until then, so being able to learn a new engine that was so accessible was really the benefit of that class.</p>

                <h1>Raytracing</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>I got into using ray casts in Godot for a bit, so I made this program that tracked ray casts and reflected them across surfaces, combining colors and light values, and then produced these images.</p>
                    <p>There were a few versions, but the picture on the bottom is the best result I got out of it both time wise (which still took an hour to render) and quality wise.</p>
