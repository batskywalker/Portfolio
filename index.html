                <h1>Asteroids Clone... Kinda</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>The goal of this game is the same as asteroids, survive and destroy asteroids. However, when you get hit, a random part of your ship gets damaged, which will effect how your ship works. To fix the damage, you need to enter the code that shows in the monitor on the left into the right order on the big buttons in the middle of the console. The materials were all free assets online, but everything else, including the models was made by me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I made this for my first game design community college class. It was a class all about using Godot 2d and learning about game design. I didn't exactly stick to the 2d part.</p>
                    <p>By this time I was already used to the idea of a game engine, having been learning unity up until then, so being able to learn a new engine that was so accessible was really the benefit of that class.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>I got into using ray casts in Godot for a bit, so I made this program that tracked ray casts and reflected them across surfaces, combining colors and light values, and then produced these images.</p>
                    <p>There were a few versions, but the picture on the bottom is the best result I got out of it both time wise (which still took an hour to render) and quality wise.</p>

                <h1>Rock Climbing Prototype</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>A prototype for a rock climbing roguelike I made for a game jam. You use each mouse button to grab with the corresponding hand. WAD moves the camera up, left, and right. It was meant for when the route gets tricky so you could plan ahead.</p>
                    <p>The game jam theme was scale and my group couldn't decide between a few options for the game jam and I really liked this idea so I made a prototype for it in a day to try to convince them. They didn't decide to move forward with it, and the group kind of fizzled out before finishing the actual game.</p>
