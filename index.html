        My name is Aaron Place. I'm based nearby Portland, Oregon. I work as a website developer. I design, develop, and optimize websites. But, on the side, I am very passionate about game development. I typically work on projects by myself, but when I can rally together a team, its always a great time, even if we don't finish anything.
